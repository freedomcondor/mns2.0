In this scenario, the swarm is trying to form a formation with 1 drones and 4 pipucks.

            d   
         p     p

However, when starting, one of the pipucks is trapped by obstacles


               p                               o
            d                               o  p o  
         p     p                               o

The swarm will switch formations to push the obstacle away to rescue the trapped pipuck out

                                            o  p o
                               push up     ppp o
                                            d


                                            o  o
                                           ppp p o
                                            d  o


                                            o  o
                                      ppp p      o
                                       d       o


                              p   p         o  o
                                d                o
                              p   p            o

      I think top down would be OK.
