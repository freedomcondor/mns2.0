In this scenario, the swarm will do the formation switch with the tunnel scenario. However, there will be a certain percentage of the robots fail in the middle.
The failure happens at step 500.

Video:
	1. Mostly top down video would be enough
	2. The failed robots would switch one the red leds. It is not very noticeable in simulation. I'm thinking maybe we can zoom in a bit to show the red leds.
