In this scenario, we do the same as exp_1_simu_04_switch_line. (The tunnel one)

But we fail 66% of the robots at the 1000th step. The rest of the robots should restore the MNS and the formation and keep move through the tunnel.

We do three sub tasks:

     1. We fail 66% of all the robots
     2. We fail 66% of only the drones
     2. We fail 66% of only the pipucks

To change this, change common.lua line 305 from:

	if vns.api.stepCount == 1000 and robot.random.uniform() < 0.66 then

to: 

	if vns.api.stepCount == 1000 and robot.random.uniform() < 0.66 and vns.robotTypeS == "drone" then

or

	if vns.api.stepCount == 1000 and robot.random.uniform() < 0.66 and vns.robotTypeS == "pipuck" then


Video:
	1. Mostly top down video would be enough
	2. The failed robots would switch one the red leds. It is not very noticeable in simulation. I'm thinking maybe we can zoom in a bit to show the red leds.
