This formation scenario, there are 10 drones and 40 pipucks, the swarm firstly form a formation, then sweep a field scattered with small obstacles, and last stop in front of an end marker.

If you want to do better, it could be cool to zoom in to show how a pipuck moves around to avoid an obstacle.
