In this scenario, there are 2 drones and 6 pipucks, the swarm firstly form a formation, then sweep a field scattered with LARGE obstacles, and last stop in front of an end marker.

            d                  oo     oo       
         p     p       -->     oo             e 
            d                      oo          
         p     p                   oo           (o: obstacles, e: end marker)


Video tips:

I think top-down for all the time should be ok.
If you want to do better, it could be cool to zoom in to show how a pipuck moves around to avoid an obstacle.
