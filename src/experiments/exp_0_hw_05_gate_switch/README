In this case, the swarm is supposed to form a formation with 2 drones and 6 pipucks, and sweep the area from one side to the other.
1. First they move across some randomly placed obstacles, each robot avoid these obstacles locally.
2. When they reach the wall, there are two gates in the wall, the swarm senses the gates and choose the larger one to move through.
3. When they see the target behind the gate, they surround it.

Video:
	1. I think a top down view most of the time would be OK.
	2. To make things better, I guess it would be nice to have a 3D top-side down view to show the 3D structure after each formation establishment (a. formation in the beginning, b, formation when moving through the gate, c, formation to surround the target)
