In this case, the swarm is supposed to form a formation with 2 drones and 6 pipucks, and sweep the area from one side to the other.
1. First they form the following formation from random positions

            p   p
              d
            p   p
              d
            p   p             (d: drone, p: pipuck)

2. Then they start to move, and move through a field with randomly placed obstacles.
   Each robot avoid these obstacles locally.

3. When they reach the wall with two gates, the swarm senses the gates and chooses the larger gate. 
   To move through the gate, the robot that is in front of the larger gate becomes the new brain, and lead the swarm to switch to the second formation.

            p   p   p
              d   d
            p   p   p

4. After the gate, when they see the target behind the gate, they switch to the last formation to surround it.

                    p
              d  p
               p    TTT
               p    TTT
              d  p
                    p          (T: target)

Video:
	1. I think a top down view most of the time would be OK.
	2. To make things better, I guess it would be nice to have a 3D top-side view to show the 3D structure after each formation establishment (a. formation in the beginning, b, formation when moving through the gate, c, formation to surround the target)
