This formation scenario, there are 10 drones and 40 pipucks, the swarm firstly form a formation, then sweep a field scattered with small obstacles, and last stop in front of an end marker.

            d                  oo

         p     p                   oo    (o: obstacles, e: end marker)


Video tips:

I think top-down for all the time should be ok.
If you want to do better, it could be cool to zoom in to show how a pipuck moves around to avoid an obstacle.
