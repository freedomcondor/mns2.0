In this scenario, the swarm is trying to form a formation with 2 drones and 6 pipucks.

         p     p     p
            d     d
         p     p     p

However, when starting, only 2 drones and 5 pipucks are together.
One pipuck is far away and can't be seen by the main cluster.
So the formation is incomplete


               p     p                                   p
            d     d
         p     p     p

After forming an incomplete formation, the swarm would split a ranger group to search for the isolated pipuck

               p             p                           p
            d       -->   d
         p     p             p

      main cluster      ranger group                    isolated pipuck

The ranger group meet the isolated pipuck, merge it in, and return to the main swarm to form a complete formation

               p                                         p
            d                        <--              d   p
         p     p                                         p


         p     p     p
            d     d   
         p     p     p


Video tip:
      I think top down would be OK.
