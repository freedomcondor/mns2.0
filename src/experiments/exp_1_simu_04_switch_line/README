The scenario looks like the same with exp_0_hw_04_switch_line, but with 10 drones and 40 pipucks:

                          ooo                   
                             ooo                
                                ooo             
         p     p                   ooo         
            d                                  
         p     p       -->                    e 
            d                                  
         p     p                   ooo          (o: obstacles, e: end marker)
                                ooo             
                             ooo                
                          ooo                   

The swarm tries to move through this tunnel which is getting narrower and narrower.
The swarm switches formation for two times to adapt to the width of the tunnel.

                          ooo                   
                             ooo
