In this scenario, robots scatter randomly in the beginning. In the end, the swarm is supposed to form a formation with 2 drones and 10 pipucks.

The formation look like this:

(p for pipuck, d for drone)

             p         p
        p         p         p
             d         d
        p         p         p
             p         p
