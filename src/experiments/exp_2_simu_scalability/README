 This is scalability case for exp_0_hw_05_gate_switch

 The swarm forms a line, moves in front of a wall with two gates, and chooses the larger one to move through, and at last surrounds a target behind it.

We do this for differenct scales of swarm. We do it with :

scale      drone       pipuck
  1          7           28
  2          13          52
  3          19          76
  4          25          100
