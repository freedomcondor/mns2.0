This scenario is a simple formation case same as exp_0_hw_01_formation_1_2d_10p, but with 3 drones and 14 pipucks.
robots scatter randomly in the beginning. In the end, the swarm forms the following formation 

(p for pipuck, d for drone)

             p         p         p
        p         p         p         p
             d         d         d
        p         p         p         p
             p         p         p
