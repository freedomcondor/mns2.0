## Guidelines
1. This project requires the latest versions of argos3 (https://github.com/ilpincy/argos3) to be installed.
	"Latest version" is only relative. The current version to work with is:
	```bash
	commit c04be869311801976a83613552e111b2eef4dd45 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)
	Author: Michael Allwright <allsey87@gmail.com>
	Date:   Wed Dec 8 13:44:48 2021 +0100

	Fix the left-right wheel offset in the 3D dynamics model for the Pi-Puck (#196)
	```
	To clone:
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/ilpincy/argos3
	cd argos3
	git checkout c04be869311801976a83613552e111b2eef4dd45
	```

2. Before compiling and installing argos, you may want to apply some patch for argos3 from folder `argos3-patch`, depends on what do you need:
	* `drone-sight-2.5m.patch` is essential, it makes drone cameras look farther than default, so that it works with pipuck-extension with larger tag. To apply the patch, go to argos3 folder and :
		```bash
		git apply ../mns2.0/argos3-patch/argos3-sight_2.5m.patch
		```
	* `unstable-drone.patch` is to make drone gyro and accelero meters more noisy so that the stablebility of the drone matches reality. 
		```bash
		git apply ../mns2.0/argos3-patch/unstable-drone.patch
		```
	* `qtopengl-tweaks.patch` is used for fixing the argos qtopengl resolution to 1920x1080 and make drawings look nicer. WARNING: this patch may be outdated
	* `babydrone.patch` is for hardware, to compile argos on a "virtual drone" on a PC. WARNING: also may be outdated.

	To compile and install argos, follow the instructions of argos. Here is a guideline, you may need to change some details.
	```bash
	cd argos3
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DARGOS_BUILD_NATIVE=ON \
	      -DARGOS_DOCUMENTATION=OFF \
	      ../src
	make -j4
	sudo make install
	```

2. After installing argos3, you are clear to build this repository. Clone the repository and run the following commands.
	```bash
	cd mns2.0
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ../src 
	make
	argos3 -c testing/test_01_formation/vns.argos
	```
	NOTE: consider using `cmake -DARGOS_BREW_QT_CELLAR=$(brew --cellar qt@5) ../src` if you are using mac with qt5.
	If everything is right, you should be able to see a group of drones and pipucks forming formations.

3. For hareware experiments, you need https://github.com/iridia-ulb/supervisor to manage all the robots. The tested version is
	```bash
	commit 68db21e732a95f5645fe0c51195bf24acc0f9f5e (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)
	Author: Michael Allwright <allsey87@gmail.com>
	Date:   Fri Mar 4 15:41:23 2022 +0100
	    Update README.md
	```
	The patch, `mns2.0/argos3-patch/supervisor-router.patch` is also recommended, which would significantly reduce the amount of wifi messages.

## Folder Explanation
0. **argos3 and cmake :** `src/cmake` contains necessary cmake files to find argos3. `src/argos3` is a simbolic link to the parent folder, it is needed for loop function to compile. Usually you wouldn't need to touch these.

1. **ARGoS loop function and user function :** They are located in `src/extensions` and `src/qtopengl_extensions`. They are based on argos3-pipuck-ext (https://github.com/iridia-ulb/argos3-pipuck-ext). Thanks to Michael, they provide a general function for most of the testing cases. For example loop function creates pipuck-exts with larger tags and records the location of each robot. user function provides function to draw arrows. For details, please refer to argos3-pipuck-ext.

2. **MNS core :**  The core source code of mns is located in `src/core`. Codes in these folders make the MNS algorithm come true.

3. **Testing :** src/testing is what the users play with. In testing folder, each subfolder is a scenario case to test one or several features of MNS, or an experiment in which a scenario got run for a load of times, and data collected and plotted. You can copy or create new subfolders to create your own scenarios and experiments.
	
	* **IMPORTANT NOTES:** The codes inside `src/testing` are pre-executable. All the codes in `src/testing` are generated by cmake in `build/testing` folder.
	For example, if you check `src/testing/test_00_environment/vns.argos.in` Line 30
	you can see a `@CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR@` in it. After cmake and make, a `build/testing/test_00_environment/vns.argos` will be generated, and this `@CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR@` would be replaced by the absolute path of your folder. It is this file that you should run, and it doesn't matter which folder you are currently at, for everything is generated in absolute paths.
	This happens to most of the files in testing, most of the files got a copy or an "configured" copy in build folder during make. So, if you want to change the code permanently, do it in `src/testing`, and cmake again. Any change in build is only temporary and would be overwritten the next time you cmake.
	
## Scenario Explanation

I have already created several scenarios to play with. 
1. A simple one is `testing/test_01_formation/` where a group of drones and pipucks form a plane shape.
2. In `testing/exp_01_real_scenario`, there is a scenario where a swarm forms, moves forward, changes the formation to move through the gate and push an object. Everything is automatic, you can just hit the play button and watch and change cameras while the robots are running.

## Data

`scripts/logReader.lua` is used to read logs, but it needs lua to read you file system, which needs: `luarocks install luafilesystem` -- Warn: this is not needed anymore in the new version
